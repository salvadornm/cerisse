## Convection vortex

This test (located in ```exm/numerics/covo```) consist of the convection of a two-dimensional vortex in an ideal gas under Mach = 0.1 using Euler equations. The physical parameters are defined following Oneraâ€™s original definition.

The vortex in the centre of the domain is defined by the stream function

$$
\Psi =  \Gamma \exp(-r/R)^2
$$

where *r* is relative to the initial positio of the vortex (x0,y0).
The velocity is therefore

$$
u = U_0 + \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial y}   \; \; \; \; \; \; \; \;  v = -\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x} 
$$

and the pressure
$$
p =  p_0 - \frac{2 \Gamma^2 }{ R^2} \exp(-r/R)^2
$$

The solution is the actual vortex propagated in *x* and the solution repeats itself every flow-through time  L/U0.

The analytical solution can be obtained by differentiating the stream function:

$$
u = U_0  -  \frac{2 \Gamma }{ R^2} \exp(-r/R)^2 (y-y_0)
$$

and

$$
v =   \frac{2 \Gamma }{ R^2} \exp(-r/R)^2 (x-x_0)
$$


The parameters are:

|            | value               |
|------------|---------------------|
| p0         | 101300  Pa          |
| rho0       |  1.1717047 kg/m3    |
| U0         | 35  m/s             |
| L          | 0.3112  m           |
| R          | L/20                |
| beta       | 0.04                |
|------------|---------------------|

where **beta* represents the strength of the vortex such that:

$$
\Gamma =  \beta U_0 R \sqrt{ \exp(1)}
$$

To run (with 2 MPI ranks)
```bash
$ mpirun -np 2 ./main2d.gnu.MPI.ex inputs
```

### Results

The results and comparison with theory can be seen by

```bash
$ python plot.py
```

Two prob.h files exist in the folder, the second order MUSCL Riemann solver (```prob.h_riemann```) and the skew-symmetric central differences (```prob.h_riemann```). Copy to ```prob.h``` to run the relevant scheme

The results after **five** flow through times for the Riemann-solver with MUSCL 2nd order reconstruction are

![covoplot](images/covo.png)

which show strong disspation.
Using the skew-symmetric 4th-order central scheme (without any high-frequency damping), the results exhibit less dissipation.

## Shock Reflection


This test ins a Mach 10 shock wave incident at 30 degrees (with adiabatic ratio of 1.4).
 The initial conditions are given in [Berger & Colella (1989)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(89)90035-1). The top boundary condition varies with time to follow the shock following the
unshocked speed. This test uses a tilted domain without EB.

### Boundary Condition Implementation

This test case is an example on how to incorporate complex boundary conditions using the ```bcnormal``` function. For example, to define manually the south boundary condition
in `prob.h`

```cpp
    case  2:  // SOUTH
     if (x[0] < 1. / 6.) {
      // post-shock conditions
      s_ext[URHO] = prob_parm.rho_l;
      s_ext[UMX]  = prob_parm.rho_l * prob_parm.u_l;
      s_ext[UMY]  = prob_parm.rho_l * prob_parm.v_l;
      s_ext[UMZ]  = 0.0;
      s_ext[UET]  =   prob_parm.eint_l + 0.5 *prob_parm.rho_l*
      (prob_parm.u_l * prob_parm.u_l + prob_parm.v_l * prob_parm.v_l);
      }
      else {
      // slip wall
      s_ext[URHO] = s_int[URHO];
      s_ext[UMX]  = s_int[UMX];
      s_ext[UMY]  = -s_int[UMY];
      s_ext[UMZ]  = s_int[UMZ];
      s_ext[UET]  = s_int[UET];
      }
      break;
```

### Results
The density iso-contours and mesh refinement looks like:

 Due to the increased resolution, a  Kelvin-Helmholtz rollup can be seen along the principal slip line

## Heat Diffusion

This test examines AMR behavior in a temperature diffusion problem with an initial condition defined as :

$$
T =  T_0 + \Delta T  \exp(-r/\delta)^2
$$

with T0=300 and DT=100. $$\Delta$$ somehow determines the width
of initial pulse and periodic boundary conditions.

The set-up is based on HAMISH validation case

gcc 14.2     | **64x64**(2 levels)        |   200 steps (t=0.02), AMR

This test case includes only a diffusion term and, as a result, does not conserve mass, momentum, or energy. The initial temperature pulse generates a non-periodic velocity field. This example is designed to assess the performance of the diffusion and heat flux modeling, rather than to represent a real-world scenario. It is important to note that the simulation will fail if heat is allowed to reach the boundaries.
