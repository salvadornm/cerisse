# Analysis
Coleman et al:

> The isothermal boundary conditions give rise to a flow that is strongly influenced by wall-normal gradients of mean density and temperature. These gradients are found to cause an enhanced streamwise coherence of the near-wall streaks, but not to seriously invalidate Morkovin's hypothesis: the magnitude of fluctuations of total temperature and especially pressure are much less than their mean values, and consequently the dominant compressibility effect is that due to mean property variations. The [Van Driest transformation](https://doi.org/10.2514/8.1895) is found to be very successful at both Mach numbers, and when properly scaled, statistics are found to agree well with data from incompressible channel flow results.
