The Shu-Osher Problem is a one-dimensional shock-turbulence interaction in which a shock propagates into a density field with artificial fluctuations. The goal  is to test the capability to accurately capture a shock wave, its interaction with an unsteady density field, and the waves propagating downstream of the shock.
