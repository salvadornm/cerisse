# 2D Riemann Problem

This is a standard test case for Euler equation solvers. It can be used to test the reconstruction scheme, AMR, and numerical stability. The initial conditions are adopted from the Configuration 3 of [Kurganov & Tadmor](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/uploads/20191119/7ec5484d12ceae1b7347c690b4ce2b73.pdf).
