# Double Mach Reflection

A Mach 10 shock wave incident at 30 degrees. The initial conditions are given in [Berger & Colella (1989)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(89)90035-1). The top boundary condition varies with time to follow the shock. The shock speed is given by $u_s = M c_s$, where $M$ and $c_s$ are Mach number and unshocked speed of sound, respectively. This version uses a tilted domain without EB.
